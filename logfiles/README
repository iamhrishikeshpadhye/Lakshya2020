Your Ubuntu system was recently compromised and most of the log files were deleted by the attackers.
However, recovery from the drives gave you some tampered log files.
The attackers must have tried several times before actually getting access to your system.
It is open that the attackers have used remote login as their weapon. 
Can you find the details of this incident?
